## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Dart-SASS
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

SASS, Mixins, @use, media queries:
$color-text-chapters: rgb(133, 70, 50);
$color-background: #F3E5D7;
$color-background-page: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
$color-background-prep: rgb(255, 247, 251);


//media queries mixins
@mixin for-phone {
    @media (max-width:375px) {@content;}
}

Working with figma files (amazing experience)

### Continued development

Javascript and then React or Vue, TBD
